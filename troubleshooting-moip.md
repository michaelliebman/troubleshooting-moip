Good morning. I want to quickly introduce myself. I'm a Principal Engineer on
SirusXM's Media Content Engineering architecture team, where we design linear
and file-based media technology systems that power the audio, metadata, and
video content on all the SirusXM and Pandora distribution platforms.

We're going to cover a lot of material in a short time, so hold on tight! First,
we'll review the troubleshooting process and what you can do to get ready to
work on MoIP systems. Then we will briefly look at the hardware tools network
engineers use before going through a bunch of tips and tricks for the software
we use for troubleshooting.

## The Troubleshooting Process & Getting Ready

::: notes

Let's get to it...

### It's not that different

::: notes

The first tip is to remember that troubleshooting MoIP systems is not that
different from working on traditional media systems. The process you follow and
the techniques you use will feel familiar to you and build on the skills you
already have.

::: notes

It *nearly* goes without saying that when troubleshooting Media over IP systems,
you should not overlook basic checks like cables or turning software switches
on.

:::

### Step 0: Prepare

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Know *your* network

* DNS servers
* NTP & PTP servers
* Typical `traceroute`
* Firewalls & VLANs
* Use DCIM & IPAM like [NetBox](https://netbox.dev/)

#### Install applications

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Bootable tool kit

[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) with:

* [Clonezilla](https://clonezilla.org/)/[Rescuezilla](https://rescuezilla.com/)
* [Gandalfâ€™s Windows 10PE](https://www.fcportables.com/gandalf-boot-iso/)
* [MS DaRT 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-desktop-optimization-pack/dart-v10/)
* [Memtest86](https://www.memtest86.com/)
* [Rescatux](https://www.supergrubdisk.org/rescatux/)
* [UltimateBootCD](https://www.ultimatebootcd.com/)

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Before you start troubleshooting MoIP (or other) systems, you should be
prepared with the knowledge and tools for the situation.

* Know your network's DNS and time servers
* Know the usual route hops you see on your network (more on `traceroute` later)
* Know where the firewalls are and the VLAN structure
* Use a data center information management (DCIM) and IP address management
  (IPAM) system like NetBox
* Install any software you need --- and there's a *bunch* we are going to cover
  --- before you need it
* Consider preparing a USB bootable tool kit. Ventoy makes it easy to not have
  to pick one. Instead, you can fill a big thumb drive with a variety, like the
  ones listed here.

### Practice Makes Perfect

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

* Use [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) or [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/) for
hands-on lab time
* Approach from another angle:

  [J. F. Kurose and K. W. Ross, Computer
networking: A top-down approach, Eighth edition. Hoboken: Pearson,
2021.](https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/index.php)

::: {.column width="50%"}

![Using GNS3 to simulate a spine-leaf architecture](images/process/gns3.png)

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

We all now how to get to Carnegie Hall, right? But how do you practice with MoIP
systems? Network simulators can be a little tricky to set up and resource hungry
once running, but you can get hands-on experience with major manufacturer
switches in realistic topologies. GNS3 and EVE-NG have open source or free
community editions available.

Most network courses and texts start at the bottom of the OSI model and work
their way up. Kurose and Ross take the rare, opposite approach of starting with
the application layer and working down. This can be more relatable to new
network engineers. (Note that this most recent edition is only available as a
physical or digital rental or a digital purchase.) Older editions are available
used, and I've learned something from every edition I've looked at.

### Troubleshooting Methods

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### CompTIA [@comptiaGuideNetworkTroubleshooting]

1. Identify the problem.
2. Develop a theory.
3. Test the theory.
4. Create an action plan.
5. Implement the solution.
6. Document the issue.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### DECSAR Method [@rossTeachingStructuredTroubleshooting2009]

1. Define the problem.
2. Examine the situation.
3. Consider the causes.
4. Consider the solution.
5. Act and test.
6. Review troubleshooting.

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Let's look at the steps we'll follow for troubleshooting networked systems. Note
that the network-specific CompTIA method is nearly identical to the generic
DECSAR method. We'll identify the problem, work up a theory about the cause,
test that theory, create a plan for correcting the issue, and close out the
documentation we've been keeping throughout the process.

::: notes

I find it useful to translate the formal OSI and TCP/IP models for networks into
a troubleshooting model. Think of it as translator for between what you see in
the wild and what you learn. Having the different perspectives helps with the
theorizing steps that we just looked at.

The upper three layers of the OSI model roughly correspond to problems or fixes
in the application that you are troubleshooting. There's disagreement on whether
the TCP/IP model includes the physical layer, but nothing works without it.
That's where our cable checks come in. In the middle are the three layers that
point you towards looking at the device protocol stack. Is the network mask
correct? Are you getting the correct DNS answer? You get the idea of the clues
that point here.

## Hardware Tools

::: notes

We've prepared ourselves, now what are some hardware tools that can help with
troubleshooting?

:::

### Cable Testers

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![Klein Tools Cable Tester](images/tools/hardware/continuity.jpg)

::: {.column width="50%"}

:heavy_check_mark: Continuity

:heavy_check_mark: Pinout

:x: Connectivity

:x: Crosstalk, attenuation, interference...

:x: Cable break location

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Cable testers will verify continuity on the conductors and tell you if the
pinout on both ends matches. Basic testers, like this Klein Tools, will *not*
tell you if a cable will work with certainty or at a specific speed.

:::

### Network Testers

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![Fluke Networks LinkIQ+](images/tools/hardware/better-continuity.jpg)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

:heavy_check_mark: Continuity

:heavy_check_mark: Pinout

:heavy_check_mark: Connectivity

:x: Crosstalk, attenuation, interference...

:x: Cable break location

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

A step-up in price, network testers will actually verify connectivity and line
rate of a connection. Features vary, but most network testers don't tell you the
quality of the cable (crosstalk, attenuation, interference, etc.) or tell you
where a break in a cable is.

:::

### Certifiers

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![Fluke Networks DSX CableAnalyzer](images/tools/hardware/certifier.jpg)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

:heavy_check_mark: Continuity

:heavy_check_mark: Pinout

:heavy_check_mark: Connectivity

:heavy_check_mark: Crosstalk, attenuation, interference...

:x: Cable break location

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Cable certifiers are often a corporate purchase and bought as part of a testing
kit. There are lots of accessories and add-ons needed to cover the cable types
you want to test. Again, features vary, but certifiers will give you statistics
for the quality of a cable and features for managing bulk cable tests.

:::

### TDRs & OTDRs

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

![EXFO MaxTester 715D](images/tools/hardware/otdr.jpg)

:information_source:  Have & [know how to use](https://www.bicsi.org/docs/default-source/conference-presentations/2017-winter/launch-cables.pdf?sfvrsn=b1af814c_2)
a launch fiber/box

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Time domain reflectometers and their optical cousins are the ultimate physical
layer troubleshooting tool. They can help you locate cable breaks and passive
network components like patches. But they are *expensive* and make sure you have
all the accessories you need, like a launch box, before you need to use your
OTDR.

:::

### Other Hardware Tools

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

* Wire stripper
* Crimp tool
* Punch down tool
* Optical Power Meter (aka light meter)
* Loopback adapter
* Tone generator

![ ](https://i.redd.it/m61xhejx90d51.jpg "Title: The messiest racks you have ever seen")

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Most of the other tools you need for working on professional media networks are
probably already in your toolkit.

:::

## Software Techniques

::: notes

Let's turn our attention to tips and tricks for software-based troubleshooting
techniques.

:::

### Check the deets

#### `ipconfig` & `netsh` (Windows)

* `/all`: Prints everything
* `/release` & `/renew`: use wildcards for interface
* `/flushdns`: Force clearing DNS cache

#### `ip` & `ifconfig` (Linux)

* `ip` combines `ifconfig` with `route` & `arp`
* `ip` has a simpler, more consistent interface [@kenlonIpVsIfconfig2023]
* `ip a`: list all addresses
* `ip a show up`: list addresses on active interfaces
* `ip -ts mon`: monitor network changes

::: notes

Unless you have a remarkable memory of a small network, you are going to want to
find out how the network is configured on a computer.

On Windows, you do that with `ipconfig`, usually with the `/all` switch. That
will print out the IP address, network mask, default router, DNS servers, and
more for every network interface. You can also `/release` or `/renew`
DHCP-assigned addresses, which you can limit to specific interfaces. Windows
interface names are long, so wildcards save some typing. Sometimes you need to
clear the DNS cache with `/flushdns` to get a new record that has an unexpired
TTL. If you need to script setting or getting the configuration, you can use
`netsh`.

On Linux, older documentation talks about `ifconfig` (interface config) for
getting most of the same information as Windows' `ipconfig`. But newer
distributions ship with the `ip` utility. You will find it easier to use, plus
it combines information about the `arp` cache and `route` table that you need to
run separately from `ifconfig` and `ipconfig`. You still need to use other
utilities for DHCP and DNS.

Like with most network device command line interfaces, you can shorten
subcommands for `ip`. Listing all IP addresses is as quick as `ip a`. If you
want to filter the address list, say to print active interfaces, add `show` plus
the query, in this case `up`. Keep track of changes to the network connections
with `ip mon`. Adding `-ts` gives you a scroll-friendly timestamp.

### Give it your best Sean Connery

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### `ping`

* Test reachability of a host
* Reports dropped packets and round trip time
* `-t` (Windows): infinite packets
* `-4`: force IPv4

#### `tracert` (Windows)/`traceroute` (Linux)

* Test each route hop to a host
* `-h` (Windows)/`-m` (Linux): max hops

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

![ ](https://i.imgflip.com/4fakj6.jpg "Title:Sean Connery in Hunt for Red October")

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

After checking the configuration of a problem computer, you will want to check
if you can reach another device. `ping` uses ICMP to send an **echo request**,
wait for an **echo reply**, and measure the round trip time. The RTT tells you
the latency of a connection. If you ignore Captain Ramius's order and add `-t`
to your Windows ping, you can measure RTT over time and look for intermittent
dropped packets. Linux defaults to infinite pings. Use [Ctrl+C]{.smallcaps} to
end the ping and show the calculated statistics. If you are pinging by name, in
particular outside your own network, `ping` may default to an IPv6 address. Use
`-4` to force pinging the target's IPv4 address.

Each "hop" on the path between devices can be the cause of dropped packets or
high latency. `traceroute`/`tracert` manipulate the time-to-live (TTL) to ping
*router* hops one by one. Note the emphasis on routers there. You can't directly
measure the impact of any switches or other layer 2 devices with `ping` or
`traceroute`. Router configurations may prevent a traceroute from ever
finishing. Use `-h` on Windows and `-m` on Linux to set the hop limit.

:::

### Exotic Pings

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### `pathping` (Windows)

* `ping` and `tracert` mashed together
* hop behavior over time

#### `arping` (Linux)

* Give it an IP, send an L2 ARP `who-has`
* Give it a MAC address, send an ICMP ping

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

![ ](https://cds.cern.ch/images/CERN-PHOTO-202109-138-6/file?size=large "Title: A chain of Large Hadron Collider magnets")

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Sometimes `ping` and `traceroute` don't give you the clues you are looking for.
ICMP pings aren't the same as TCP or UDP. You can get `ping`-like tests with
Nmap, which we'll cover later.

On Windows, `ping` and `tracert` will give you slightly different views of the
network, so why not get the best of both worlds? PathPing gives you individual
hop statistics over a longer period of time.

Linux lets you test layer 2 connectivity with `arping`. Address Resolution
Protocol maps MAC addresses to IP addresses. Give `arping` an IP address, it
will send link layer frames to the associated MAC address and report the round
trip time. Give it a MAC address, and it will ping the resolved IP address.

:::

### Outside Looking In

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Looking Glass Servers

* [BGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol) routes, `ping`,
  & `traceroute`
* Pick the physical/network location to test from
* Lists: [Traceroute.org](http://www.traceroute.org/),
  [LookinGlass.org](https://lookinglass.org/)
* Sites: [Hurricane Electric](https://bgp.he.net/),
  [Lumen](https://lookingglass.centurylink.com/)

#### SmokePing

* Long term pings with latency
* [How to read graphs](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/doc/reading.en.html)
* External pings up to 28 days: [DSLReports](https://www.dslreports.com/smokeping)
* Try [vaping](https://20c.com/project/vaping) locally
  [(Docker!)](https://github.com/20c/vaping/blob/main/docs/container.md)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

![SmokePing](https://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/demo.png)

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

All the pings we've talked about so far test from a device that you control out
to another device, but sometimes you need to test from the public Internet in to
your network. Looking glass servers let you remotely run `ping` or `traceroute`
to another device. Significant connectivity providers, like Hurricane Electric
and Lumen, run these servers, which lets you choose where you test from,
geographically and network connectivity-wise. Check the server lists to find the
right one to test with for your situation.

Want to do a quick, longer term (up to about a month) test from the outside?
DSLReports still runs a SmokePing service, which does periodic packet loss and
latency tests. Check the terms of service to make sure it works for your
situation or consider setting up `vaping` for a similar self-hosted test.

### Name That Computer: `dig` (Windows/Linux)

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

* Windows install: [Download](https://www.isc.org/download/) & **Tools Only** install
* Specific/all record type: `dig example.com <rrtype|ANY>`
* Specific DNS server: `@mydnsserver.example.com`

* Long but readable: `+multiline +noall +answer +nocmd`
* Traceroute: `+trace`
* Interactive: omit host

:::

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

You will still frequently work with IP addresses, but DNS is an important part
of modern MoIP systems. You can perform basic DNS queries with `nslookup`. When
you need to look up more specialized or complex records, like NMOS can use, you
will need to `dig` for the information. With `dig` you can request a specific
record type, like `PTR` or `TXT` (used by NMOS), or all records for a name by
with the pseudotype of `ALL`.

`nslookup` can be confusing when you need to query a specific DNS server. With
`dig`, you identify the DNS server by prefacing it with an `@` symbol. `dig`
defaults to printing a lot of information about your query, but sometimes that's
TMI. Fortunately, you can format the response for the situation. `+short` gives
you the answer to the query with nothing else, great for scripting. If you still
want a longer view of the answer, but without the default query information,
there are options for that, too. You can even follow the resolution path from
root server to authoritative server, for a sort of DNS traceroute. If you have a
lot of DNS queries to run, you can enter interactive mode by leaving off the
target address.

### What's This Computer Doing?

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### `netstat` (Windows)

* Choose protocol: `-p (tcp|udp)`
* Only listening ports: `netstat -a | find /i "listening"`
* GUI: [TCPView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview)
  or [Resource Monitor](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23718720/6283412)

#### `ss` (Linux)

* Choose protocol: `--tcp` or `--udp`
* Only listening ports: `-l`
* [Filters](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/iproute2/ss.8.en.html):
  `ss -nt dst 192.0.2.0/24`

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

What a computer is (or isn't) doing on a network isn't always visible from the
applications we use. Is the server actually waiting for incoming connections?
Which server did the app actually connect to?

On Windows, the command line tool `netstat` ("network statistics") can show
incoming and outgoing connections. It can be helpful to limit the protocol to
TCP or UDP individually, since the lists get long. Printing all the listening
ports with `-l` answers that first question about waiting for incoming
connections.

For Linux, you can still use `netstat`, though the syntax is a little different
from the Windows command. The newer `ss` utility gives you more control over
that long list of connections with filters. The command above will show all TCP
connections by port number (not name) destined for the 192.0.2.0 subnet.

:::

### What's That Computer Doing?

:warning: Get permission and think about maintenance windows before using these tools!

#### Port scanning: [Nmap](https://nmap.org/)

* Scan multiple ports & addresses: `nmap -p 80,25,443,110 198.51.100.20-100`
* Service & version detection: `-sV`
* OS detection: `-O`

#### Vulnerability Scanning

* [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) or [OpenVAS](https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-scanner)
* Use [the containerized build](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/22.4/container/)

::: notes

Before we talk about finding out what is going on with another computer on a
network, proceed with caution. Make sure you have permission to use these tools.
If your enterprise security team is doing their job, they will know what you are
up to. Besides being concerned about policy violation risks, there is another,
familiar risk to consider. Depending on how you use these tools, they carry the
danger of causing outages. Consider running these tools during planned
maintenance windows and on offline systems.

With that out of the way, let's talk about how to find out what is going on with
another device, especially one you don't have the ability to work directly on.
(But you have permission to muck around, right?) You can use Nmap to scan for
open ports, those programs waiting for incoming connections. Nmap can also
guess at the specific service and version running or detect the OS of the
scanned device.

Vulnerability scanning is an essential part of security preparedness. You want
to know what your exposure is, so you can take the right mitigation steps.
The most common response is remediation, or patching the vulnerability, but you
might take other actions until you verify the patch with a vendor or test it out
yourself. Nessus and the less commercialized OpenVAS (aka Greenbone) scanners
are the most common in use. Use OpenVAS's Docker container to get up and running
fast and without unnecessary complexity.

::::::::::::::

::: notes

We'll be covering packet capture and analysis in more depth later today, but I
do want to share one Wireshark tip with you. Use *capture* filters as much as
you can to keep your memory and file sizes manageable. Display filters are
easier to work with and more expressive, but media systems are chatty,
generating a lot of packets that take some sifting. I try to start with a short,
unfiltered capture, figure out the packets I'm generally interested in, and then
run a longer capture that filters out as much of the noise as possible.

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

Working with "real" network traffic isn't always possible or ideal. Packet
generators let you synthesize or replay network traffic. One common use case is
for load testing. Some packet generators can pump out *a lot* of flows, more
than you can reasonably get going by hand with a few clients in a lab
environment.

But commercial packet generators can be well beyond our budgets, and we need
some packets to learn or experiment with. [Ostinato](https://ostinato.org/) is
open source, free as in beer if you build it yourself, or affordably available
as pre-built binaries.

:::
::::::::::::::

::: notes

"Is it fast enough?" The specs say that the disk, CPU, RAM... name your
component should be, but we all know reality doesn't match spec sheets. Even
though IOMeter hasn't been updated in a while, it remains the best disk
performance benchmarking tool readily available. Spend a bit of time working out
a realistic test plan for your benchmark. You can simulate different phases of
disk use. Generally, you can have as many workers to create I/O load as you have
cores or vCPUs available to your test machine. Be careful about selecting disks
to test, you don't want to put a system disk or project files in danger.

For network performance tests, Iperf2 and Iperf3 have overlapping feature sets.
Iperf2 is better for multicast and other media flows. Use Iperf3 for more
typical IT workload or public Internet tests. No matter which version you use,
you need to install Iperf on two devices. One simulates a server and listens for
incoming connections, while the other plays the client role and sends simulated
data to the server.

### Time

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### NTP

* 1, 2 with `prefer`, or 3+ servers
* Windows: Use the [Meinberg NTP port](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/sw/ntp.htm)
* Simple monitoring with `ntpq` or [Meinberg NTP Monitor](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/sw/ntp-server-monitor.htm)

#### PTP

* Monitor with [Meinberg PTP Track Hound](https://www.meinbergglobal.com/english/sw/ptp-track-hound.htm)
* Analyze with [EBU LIST](https://github.com/ebu/pi-list)

::: notes

When troubleshooting time related issues, one of your first checks should be a
device's NTP source. You need to specify 1 or 3 or more NTP servers for the
client to work properly. If you have 2 NTP servers, common in media facilities
with a pair of redundant sync generators, you have to set one of those sources
as the preferred source. The NTP algorithm won't be able to figure out the
correct adjustment without a preferred server.

Another common problem is using the built-in Windows time client. Do yourself a
favor, disable that service and install the Meinberg port of the reference NTP
tools. That client works, uses the same easy to distribute configuration file as
the Linux version, and gives you `ntpq` for basic monitoring.

Meinberg also has a separate NTP monitoring tool, as well as free and paid PTP
monitoring solutions. For PTP, you can use EBU LIST for detailed analysis.

### APIs

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

* Use API testers like [milkman](https://github.com/warmuuh/milkman),
  [bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno), and [insomnium](https://github.com/ArchGPT/insomnium)
  * Find more [Awesome API Clients](https://github.com/stepci/awesome-api-clients?tab=readme-ov-file)
* Use [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/) descriptions or
[smithy](https://smithy.io/) contracts
  * Example: [NMOS IS-05](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-05/releases/v1.1.2/APIs/ConnectionAPI.html)
  ([source](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/is-05/blob/v1.1.x/APIs/ConnectionAPI.raml))

::: notes

The first time you come face to face with a RESTful API, it can feel like a bit
of a dark art, but there are two ways to turn that art into science. First,
don't try to handcraft an API request. Use an API testing tool. Leading free or
open source testers have recently made user un-friendly changes, so I can't
strongly recommend one right now. There are plenty of choices depending on your
needs and preferences.

The second tip for API troubleshooting is you should try to work from formal API
specifications, often in the form of OpenAPI descriptions or smithy contracts
for event-based APIs.

::: notes

There are some great open source and freely available tools for NMOS and SMPTE
ST 2110 troubleshooting. Mentioned before, EBU LIST is great for analyzing your
video and audio flows. Different vendors have different implementations and
interpretations of SDP descriptions, which sdpoker can help you reconcile.

AMWA, the organization behind NMOS has also released an automated testing tool.
This is the same setup used during the JT-NM tested events that you can use for
verifying compatibility for the devices and systems that you use in your
facility.

Whether you are trying to learn more, test new devices, or you are actively
troubleshooting an issue, how many times have you wished you could set up your
own router control system? In the MoIP world, we can actually do that, and there
even is an "easy button" for it. Easy-NMOS is a docker compose-based recipe for
spinning up an NMOS registry, a virtual node, and the testing tool.

Also, Riedel has a freely available browser for quick peeks into an NMOS
registry.

* Understand [docker networks](https://dev.to/manojpatra1991/docker-cheat-sheet-docker-networks-49k4)
  * Don't use `bridge0`
  * Expose minimal ports with `-p`
* [netshoot](https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot): "a Docker +
  Kubernetes network trouble-shooting swiss-army container"

::: notes

Containers can make your life easier, but if you have to troubleshoot Docker
networking, you might be questioning your tech stack choices. First, make sure
you understand how docker networks work. A good cheat sheet will help with some
secure best practices, like not using the default network and only exposing
necessary ports.

You can use the `netshoot` container to access some great troubleshooting tools.
But its real strength is being able to troubleshoot from inside a specific
docker network or even inside another container's namespace. You'll need to do
that when you don't have those troubleshooting tools already built in to the
problem container.

If you still can't make sense of a Docker issue, it can help to go back to the
basics. The `whoami` container, from the Traefik reverse proxy team, gives you
all the building blocks of a real container --- latency, a JSON api, health
checks --- stripped down to lightweight essentials. Get your network problem
sorted out with `whoami` and then go back to your real container.

The last tip I'll leave you with is to keep your eyes open. You never know when
you'll find the next tool or technique that will help you solve problems faster
or deal with more complex or just plain weird issues. Stress test multicast?
Get a hammer. Need a down and dirty RTP stream? Fire up VLC. There's lots more
Awesome out there.
